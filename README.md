# eosKeygen

If you are new to EOS, you may already know it's really hard to get EOS Keypairs without Scatter.
If you already get used to Matamask, you may need some time to get used to Scatter as well.

### Transparency
I haven't even migrated Database to this project. 

No WSGI, No Webserver, No Database, Only Django + Nodejs for Using eosjs.

Try the service, [https://eos.randomwork.io](https://eos.randomwork.io)

More Service Will come!
